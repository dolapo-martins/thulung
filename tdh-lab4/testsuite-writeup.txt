2. Testsuite documentation
======valence-changing lexical rules======
We added causativizer, benefactive, and detransitivizer.

#27
gu-ka me-lai si-be-ɖy
3sg-erg that-dat die-cau-3sg.pst
'He ordered her to die.'
#28
gu-ka me-lai si-ɖy
3sg-erg that-dat die-3sg.pst
'He ordered her to die.'

The causative marker 'be' is attached to an intransitive verb stem '-si' in #27, such that the VP can select
a new patient role 'me'. In comparison, #28 is ungrammatical, since the intransitive verb takes a patient 
role as comps argument.

#30
ʦysy-ka sʌŋ mam-lai kluk-saʈ-ɖʉchild-erg wood mother-dat fetch-ben-3sg.3sg.pst'The child took out wood for mother.'
Ex1
ʦysy-ka sʌŋ kluk-saʈ-ɖʉchild-erg wood fetch-3sg.3sg.pst'The child took out wood.'

The benefactive (or applicative) marker '-saʈ' is attached to a mono-transitive verb stem 'kluk', such that 
the VP can select one role 'mam' as benefactor of the action. Ex1 is not in the testsuite, since it does 
not contain a valence changing morpheme, but it should also be grammatical and showcases the effect of a 
benefactive marker. Without 'saʈ', the VP only selects one argument in comps.

#32
khel per-siʈ-ɖaleg pinch-detr-3sg.pst'Leg got pinched.'

The detransitivizer marker '-siʈ' removes the object from a transitive verb. In #32, 'per', which is a 
transitive verb, after taking the detr morpheme, selects no argument in the comps list.
N.b. We received an updated version of descriptive grammar by Doctor Lahaussois, where '-siʈ' is defined as 
an allomorph for reflexivization. The main function is to express co-reference between two NPs. One of the 
other functions is called 'anticausative', which corresponds to the detransitivizer function that we use 
here. Our grammar has not yet incorporated this marker into the new reflexivization category.

======adnominal possession======
#35
u-khlea am3sg.poss-dog sleep.3sg'His dog sleeps.'
#36
uma-khlea am3sg.poss-dog sleep.3sg'His dog sleeps.'
#37
uma am3sg.pron sleep.3sg'His (dog) sleeps.'
All three sentences above are grammatical. Both 'u' and 'uma' are 3sg possessive markers attached to the 
noun. The difference between 'u' and 'uma' is that 'u' must be prefixed to a noun, while 'uma' can be a 
stand-alone word without being attached to a noun. We believe this construction is based on specific 
discourse features, where the possessum can be assumed through context.

======adverbial clausal modifiers======
#62
gu am mala go am-ŋu3sg sleep.3sg cond 1sg sleep.1sg'If he sleeps, I sleep.'
#63
gu am mala3sg sleep.3sg'If he sleeps'

The conditional 'mala' connects two cluases, the first being the condition and the second being the result.
It has to be between two clauses for the sentence to be grammatical. #63 is ungrammatical for this reason.

======coordination======
We have also added coordination rule for NPs and VPs.
#60
darembu popnar ba-t-ʦi
Darembu Popnar be-pst-du
'There were two people called Darempu and Popnar.'
NPs do not take any coordinator between them, so #60 is grammatical.

#56
ba-ŋu ma am-ŋu ma am-ŋu
be-1sg conj sleep-1sg conj sleep-1sg
'I am and I sleep and I sleep.'
On the other hand, VPs and clauses takes coordinator 'ma' in polysyndeton.
n.b. Thulung is a pro-drop language. Pronouns are optional for VPs to form sentences.

======tense======
The majority of this week's work is on constructing position classes for verb endings. More specifically,
Thulung verb suffixes select tense, number, and person in one (sometimes two) morpheme.

#49
gu-ka go-lai khlo-ŋiri3sg-erg 1sg-dat trap-3sg.1sg.pst'He trapped me.'
#50
gu-ka go-lai khlo-na3sg-erg 1sg-dat trap-3sg.2sg.pst'He trapped me.'
#49 is grammatical, because '-ŋiri' selects a 3sg agent and 1st pagent in past tense. On the other hand,
#50 is ungrammatical, because the verb suffix selects a 2sg patient, but a 1sg is marked as its patient in 
dative.

#41
ba-t-tsi
be-pst-3du
'There were two people.'
#42
ba-ttsi
be-3du.pst
'There were two people.'
Both #41 and $42 are grammatical. According to our descriptive grammar, '-t' is historically a past tense 
marker and has fused with some person/number markers. Our grammar marks both cases grammatical. In #42, 
the verb takes a past tense marker first, then a 3dual marker. In #43, the verb takes one single suffix 
that 
encodes both past tense and 3du for the subject.
