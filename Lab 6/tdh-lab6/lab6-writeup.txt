1. semi.vpm
Thulung has a pernum feature, so we revised this part in the semi to map to the separate per and num values.
PNG.PERNUM : PER NUM
  3sg <> third sg
  2sg <> second sg
  1sg <> first sg
  3pl <> third pl
  2pl <> second pl
  1pl <> first pl
  1pl_excl >> first pl
  1pl_incl >> first pl
  3du >> third pl
  2du >> second pl
  1du_excl >> first pl
  1du_incl >> first pl
  1du >> first pl
  3plain << third sg
  2plain << second sg
  1plain << first sg
  3polite << third sg
  2polite << second sg
  1polite << first sg
  3rd <> third !
  3rd << third *
  2nd <> second !
  2nd << second *
  1st <> first !
  1st << first *
  sg <> ! sg
  sg << * sg
  pl <> ! pl
  pl << * pl
  * <> ! !

English does not distinguish between dual and plural, so we mapped both plural (paucal) and dual from the internal side to the external side unidirectionally. Similarly, English also does not distinguish between inclusive and exclusive, so we also mapped 1du/pl_incl/excl to first pl unidirectionally. We also have a polite/plain distinction for number in Thulung that we mapped from English. 

We also modified the tense and aspect section.
E.TENSE : TENSE
  nonpast << present
  nonpast << future
  past <> past
  * <> *
E.ASPECT : ASPECT
  * >> no-aspect
  no-aspect << [e]

Since Thulung only has non-past and past tense, we mapped nonpast from the internal side to both present and future on the external side unidirectionally. We also defined no-aspect as the default aspect.

The following shows a comparison before and after the change to semi.vpm and cutting down underspecified morphology. Our result if still ambiguous, possibly due to the verb ending system.

A description of the phenomena you improved in the grammar (including both the morphology etc clean up and adnominal possession or clausal complements), including:
Prose description of the phenomenon
Prose description of your analysis
The specific changes you made to the tdl (paste in the actual tdl)
Specific IGT I can use to test the analysis / investigate if something isn't working and you need help.


We made a few changes to our grammar. 
1. We added negation as a prefix, to the tense-inflected verb and updated our rules accordingly. In Thulung, verbs are negated by adding the prefixes /mi-/ or /me-/.

2. We took an analysis of demonstratives as determiners. We did/do not understand how to create grammar rules such that two words are combined to create a phrase. That is, if we took an analysis of demonstratives as pronouns, how would we account for things like "Those cars" unless we analyzed demonstratives as determiners? 
- We need a grammar rule that says (DEM) NP => NP but since we don't know how to define that in the customization system, we chose to analyze demonstratives as determiners such that we can leverage (DP) NP => NP. This analysis isn't quite accurate however as our source materials do not reference any determiners in Thulung.
N.B. Based on your Lab 5 comments, we should have posted this question to Canvas.

3. We are working to reduce ambiguity caused by lexical rules to account for underspecification. We realized that we have been chaining rules instead of subclassing them. For example, our analysis of past transitives should have sublassed the TRANSITIVE-ROLE-MARKING position class instead of creating a new position class that takes it as input. 

N.B. We didn't have time  to implement the genitive construction like recommended in your Lab 5 comments. Since we've started using tdl editing, we are unsure what edits we need to make to get this working. We will send this for assistance in class sections.
