Description of MRS refinement
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Lab 8, we worked on harmonizing our MRSes for sentences that were possible in Thulung. As such, we didn't need to make many changes in Lab 9 to harmonize the MRSes. The changes we needed to make were related to the semi.vpm.

We added 
no-mood: mood in our thulung.tdl file
Then we changed our mood section in semi.vpm, keeping only irrealis mood, which is the mood we worked on for the past tense negation.
This resulted in our semi.vpm section going from 
    E.MOOD : E.MOOD
    IRR <> IRR
    IMP <> IMP
    OBL <> OBL
    * <> *
to,
    E.MOOD : MOOD
    IRR <> IRR
    ;  IMP >> *
    ;  OBL >> *
    * >> no-mood
    no-mood << [e]

MMT coverage for sje and eng
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following sentences successfully produce output generation from 
(source) -> (target)
eng -> tdh (1) (2*) (3*) (4) (5*) (8*) (9*) (15) (16) (17) (19)

sje -> tdh (1) (2*) (3*) (4*) (5*) (8*) (9*) (19)

Regarding sentence 10 (coordination over VPs): we are working on the transfer rule for this complex construction but haven't completed it yet.
Our descriptive materials do not provide prose of coordination over VPs and this sentence involves coordinating intransitive and transitive verbs. In Thulung, case constraints differ for the agent/subject of these two verb classes. As discussed in class, this requires us to write a transfer rule such that one of the verbs is treated as having a pro-dropped subject. The semantics would would be something like [cats chase dogs and (something) sleeps] where the "something" pragmatically refers to cat.

Lab 9 initial grammar on provided test corpus -> use Lab 8 final grammar
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How many items parsed:                                  |          12          |
What is the average number of parses per parsed item:   |         7.67         |
