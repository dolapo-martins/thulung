Sources of ambiguity: There is a lot of ambiguity with verbs. For example, 'ba' has four lexical entries, but three of them have the same semantic value. We also see ambiguity in verb lexical rules, where several lexical rules are applied to form the same VP. For example, '-ka' can be attached as either an ERG or INSTR marker. The same ambiguity applies to noun lexical entries and lexical rules.

10 items that parsed:
-------------------------------------------------
lo   be-to   rok-ɖa
frog do-_cvb come-3_sg._pst
He came to ask for the frogs.
The 3rd person in [x] makes sense as it links the frog to the action. TAM values are not specified in [e] except for aspect, but they link the auxiliary 'do' and 'come'. However, there is no relation between 'ask' and 'frog'. 

dyms-ɖa           ʔe
become-3_sg._pst  _hs
When he went it became time to go home
The '_hs_n_rel' does not seem to correspond to 'go home', but is linked with [x].

lʌks-thal-ɖa 	    ʔe
go-_aux-3_sg._pst   _hs
During the winter he went down to the lower elevations.
The translation offers additional locative and temporal information about . '_hs_n_rel', which is the hearsay marker. is identified with third person subject of 'go'.

mapahaŋ   rwak-ma
Mapahang  speak-_pst._ptcp
The king had a younger brother called Mapahang.
The constituent for 'king' cannot be found in the MRS, but '_say_v_rel' does link its second argument with 'exist', which also links to 'Mapahang'.

dyms   mɵ   ʦa-ma            sɵ-ra
become that roast-_pst._ptcp meat-_loc
Nowadays when we eat roasted meat it has a salty taste in that roasted meat.
The MRS makes sense, but the translation does not. The second argument of 'become' is linked to 
the second argument of 'roast', and the first argument of 'become' is linked to the L-INDEX of
the coordination.

si-mu     lam
die-_inf  path
They said that however a person has died it should not be difficult to show the path for dealing with body. We will create a path for dying. 
The second argument of 'die' (why is there two?) is linked to the sole argument of 'path'. The 
sentence makes sense semantically.

moʦy dyms-ʦi
wife become-_du
After that they became a couple there they became husband and wife.
The first argument of 'exist' is linked to the second argument of 'become', but the first argument of 'become' is linked to a prop-or-ques, which does not make sense.

be-thal-ɖy            ʔe
do-_aux-3_sg._pst._a  _hs 
When I roar from the ridge look down in the depths he said he s so fast that by the time the sound 
carries he s in the opposite place. 
The second argument of 'do' is linked with the argument n 'exist' in '_hs_n_rel'. The semantics of 
this sentence makes sense.

be-ɖy             ʔe
do-3_sg._pst._a   _hs 
Mini told his mother Be angry with him tell him to hold still otherwise I will shoot and kill him with my bow and arrow 
This sentence has the same MRS as the above example. The only difference is the lack of an auxiliary.

mijakma mal-ɖa           jok-ɖa               ʔe-ma
Miyakma search.for-_purp come.down-3_sg._pst _hs-and.then
Then they fixed a date and Khomda came to get Miyakma.
The MRS for this sentence makes sense. The entity 'Miyakma' is identified in 'exist', 'Miyakma', 
search for', coordination, and 'come down'.

6 items that parsed:
-------------------------------------------------
bet-thal-ʦi ʔe
make-_aux-_du _hs
'And the two sisters took care of their brother K and looked after him.''
Tag x4 identities the second argument of 'make' with the first argument of 'exist' and the first argument of 'hearsay'. We have seen hearsay being identified with both NP and VP, which both make sense semantically.

bet-ʦi ʔe
make-_du _hs
'And the two sisters took care of their brother K and looked after him.'
Same MRS as the sentence above, except for the lack of specification on aspect.
